Faction setup hooks.

Factions get their own hooks that are called for various reasons, but the most common one is to set up a character
once it's created and assigned to a certain faction. For example, giving a police faction character a weapon on creation.
These hooks are used in faction tables that are created in `schema/factions/sh_factionname.lua` and cannot be used like
regular gamemode hooks.
