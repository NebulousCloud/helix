--[[--
Holds information sent by a client for creating a new character.

The character creation payload is used to hold data about the variables to set on the character once it's created. This will
usually include things like the name, model, and description by default. If you are implementing your own character menu and
want to create a payload to send to the server, you can do so with `ix.charmenu.CreatePayload`. This will populate
`Payload.vars` with an array of character var keys from `ix.char.vars` that will be sent to the server and validated.

Accessing the character var object that this payload has can be done with:
	print(ix.char.vars[payload.uniqueid])
Where `uniqueid` is replaced with the unique id of the character var in `ix.char.vars`.
